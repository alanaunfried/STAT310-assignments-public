This is a workspace for you to work on your final visualizations OUTSIDE of the final project dashboard. I recommend developing your visualizations and data cleaning here, then copying your code into the dashboard file where appropriate. This file will not be graded; only your final dashboard is graded. 



## Data Source

Include links and information to the data used, describe the data and plan out your questions. Read in the data.

```{r}

```



## Data Cleaning

Write any code needed to clean or prepare your data if needed to make your visualizations

```{r}

```



## Visualization Preparation

Provide any code to create your visualizations or perhaps to play around with different ideas.  You can leave code here that you might not use in your final dashboard.

```{r}

```
